BASIC INSTALLATION

  Note: there's an installation script available from
    https://gist.github.com/Gargaj/2a8cb8c015244b6431b9
  that can pretty much set most things up on a blank Linux install.
  
  APACHE

    1. Set up a basic Apache server with two virtual hosts, one for the
       users and one for the admins.
       One convenient way to configure this is
         http://party.lan pointing to /var/www/party
         http://admin.lan pointing to /var/www/admin
       The admin one is recommended to have SSL configured.
         
       It's important to set up a working nameserver too!
    
    2. Set AllowOverride in your Apache configs to All.

  MYSQL 
  
    1. Set up a MySQL server, create a database, and create an account
       that has full read/write access to the database.
       
  MISC UNIX STUFF
     
    1. Create a directory where you will store your compo entries.
       This dir has to be readable and writeable by Apache, and for
       convenience, it's useful if it's the root dir of a password
       protected FTP.  
    
    2. Create another directory, where you will store the screenshots.
       This dir has to be readable and writeable by Apache, but it will
       only serve as storage, it doesn't have to be accessible by
       anything else.
       
    3. Unpack the www_admin dir into your admin dir and
       unpack the www_party dir into your party dir.
  
  DEPLOYMENT 
       
    1. Open your admin interface in a web browser.
       It should bring you to the deployment form.
       
    2. Fill the form accordingly, and remember to use
       absolute paths everywhere.
       
    3. On success, you should be forwarded to the admin interface.
       Note that if you set a user/pass for the interface, you will be
       prompted for it.
       
CONFIGURATION

  Adding compos:
    
    Open the "Compos" link in the admin menu.
    Here you can add and organize competitions - important note is
    that the directory name obviously shouldn't contain weirdo
    characters.
    
  Generating votekeys:
  
    Click the "Votekeys" link.
    Here you can generate votekeys for the attendants - remember
    never to re-generate votekeys after you've printed them out!

  Page contents:
  
    Pages can be dynamically added and removed from the partynet.
    They all use a slightly mutated version of the Wiki-syntax.
    See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Cheatsheet for
    details.
        
SETTING UP AND USING THE BEAM SYSTEM (DESKTOP)

  NOTE: this is becoming deprecated.

  1. Unpack the exe_beamer directory on the beamer PC.
  
  2. Change the line 
       <sourceurl>http://admin.lan/result.xml</sourceurl>
     so that it corresponds to the (not yet existing) file at the
     admin interface.
     
     If you password protected your admin interface, use the syntax
       https://username:password@host...
  
  3. Edit the config.xml to your needs (this is basically skinning
     and editing colors, etc.)
     
  4. Put your partyslides in the "slides" directory, and
     optionally change the line 
       <slideurl>https://admin.lan/slides/</slideurl>
     so that it corresponds to the "slides" directory at the
     admin interface (see above for syntax).
     
     Remember: if you refresh your slides from the internet,
     it will delete your local ones!
  
  5. Start the executable.

SETTING UP AND USING THE BEAM SYSTEM (BROWSER)
  
  1. Click the "Slideviewer" link in the admin
  
  2. Enter the original slide resolution in which the design was done
  
  3. Press "Open viewer" - most browsers allow you to switch to
     fullscreen with F11.
  
  Both beam systems rely on simple keypresses for operation.
  
  ALT-F4 - quit
  LEFT ARROW - previous slide / minus one minute in countdown mode
  RIGHT ARROW - next slide / plus one minute in countdown mode
  HOME - first slide
  END - last slide
  S - partyslide rotation mode
  R - re-download partyslides from the intranet (not needed for browser)
  SPACE - re-read result.xml (and quit partyslide mode)
    
  This last key essentially means that once you've used the "BEAMER"
  menu on the admin interface, you must press SPACE to refresh the
  data inside (and/or switch to another mode).
